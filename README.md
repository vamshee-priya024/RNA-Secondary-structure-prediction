# RNA-Secondary-structure-prediction

**Abstract**

**Motivation:** The motivation behind the research is to address the limitations of existing learning-based models for RNA secondary structure prediction. The authors aim to demonstrate that intra-family performance is not sufficient evidence of generalization and propose a more rigorous method for inter-family cross-validation. They emphasize the need to assess the performance of learning-based models in the inter-family case, which is more relevant for practical applications.

**Results:** We demonstrate that it is nearly trivial with convolutional neural networks to generate pseudo-free energy changes, modelled after structure mapping data that improve the accuracy of structure prediction for intra-family cases. We propose a more rigorous method for inter-family cross-validation that can be used to assess the performance of learning-based models. Using this method, we further demonstrate that intra-family performance is insufficient proof of generalization despite the widespread assumption in the literature and provide strong evidence that many existing learning-based models have not generalized inter-family.
